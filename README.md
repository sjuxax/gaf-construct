# GAF-Construct

Describe the [GAF file format](https://gafmedia.com) in a way that's readable
by [Construct](https://github.com/construct/construct) 2.8.

Made available as a reference/starting point. Not very useful on its own.
Based on [StageXL-GAF](https://github.com/bp74/StageXL_GAF)'s implementation.

Does not read compressed GAFs yet, but should be easy to extend.
